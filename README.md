# Dynamical-Systems-Analysis
This project involves four main tasks in scientific machine learning and control theory. First, a neural network is trained to solve the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equation using data generated from the provided Python notebook, and the model's predicted trajectories are compared with true system solutions under different initial conditions. The second task uses Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) on fluid flow snapshot data to extract dominant system modes and forecast future behavior. In the third task, nonlinear system identification techniques are applied to time series datasets representing state variables and their derivatives to discover the underlying governing equations. Finally, the fourth task explores linear control theory by analyzing the controllability and observability of a given system and designing a state-feedback control law to stabilize another system using the form 𝑢=𝐾𝑥
